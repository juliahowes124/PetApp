# An app that has yet to be named
A platform where owners looking to rehome their pet can connect with prospective adopters.

## Inspiration
After gaining an initial exposure to ASP.NET Core and Angular applications from this Udemy course: (https://www.udemy.com/course/build-an-app-with-aspnet-core-and-angular-from-scratch/),
I wanted to take what I learned and apply it to a real-world problem that I have always been passionate about: animal homelessness. I recently came across the website (https://getyourpet.com/) , and was impressed with their unique approach to helping solve the animal shelter
crisis. By providing a way for pet owners to directly connect with individuals looking to adopt, they can completely bypass the shelter system,
freeing up space and resources for the stray and abused animals, which also helps to prevent euthinasia and the spread of illness within the shelters.
It also significantly reduces stress on the animal by smoothly transitioning them directly from one home to another.
My goal for this project was to start by building the major features of this website using the knowledge I gained from Udemy.
